advance narration and initiate animations. We advance the study of narrative visualization through an analysis of a curated collection of
recent data-driven stories shared on the web. Drawing from the results of this analysis, we present a set of techniques being employed
in these examples, organized under four high-level categories that help authors to tell stories in creative ways: communicating narrative
and explaining data, linking separated story elements, enhancing structure and navigation, and providing controlled exploration. We describe the benefits of each storytelling technique along with a number of example applications of the ideas through recent data-driven stories.

A focus group of nurse managers, physicians, and hospital quality professionals was conducted to identify design criteria for the HIT dashboard. The dashboard was developed from dynamic process data from a medical surgical unit in a Midwestern, academic hospital using human factors principles. Heuristic and system usability evaluations were performed to assess the HIT dashboard’s functionality and usability. Evaluation results suggest that the HIT dashboard was considered “good” by evaluators (following System Usability Scale criteria), with five suggested changes being recommended by 40\% or more of the heuristic evaluators. This work provides a preliminary model for the development of future HIT dashboards intended to communicate patient risk information to hospital care staff.},

The dashboard was developed from dynamic process data from a medical surgical unit in a Midwestern, academic hospital using human factors principles. Heuristic and system usability evaluations were performed to assess the HIT dashboard’s functionality and usability. Evaluation results suggest that the HIT dashboard was considered “good” by evaluators (following System Usability Scale criteria), with five suggested changes being recommended by 40\% or more of the heuristic evaluators. This work provides a preliminary model for the development of future HIT dashboards intended to communicate patient risk information to hospital care staff.},

However, there is always uncertainty to determine the best method that complements user testing in a depth usability assessment. Nowadays, the concern of many software developers is to identify an appropriate methodology, whose evaluation methods could be capable of measuring all usability aspects of a user interface. For this reason, we conducted a heuristic evaluation as a preliminary step to the implementation of a usability test, in order to determine in which extent these methods complement each other, and establish the gaps which are covered by each of them. The heuristic evaluation was performed by five specialists in the field of Human-Computer Interaction, who identified a total of fifty-nine usability problems in a transactional web site. Subsequently, a usability test was conducted with the participation of eight postgraduate students of a master's program in Informatics Engineering. The results show that most of the usability problems which were detected during the usability testing, had already been identified by the heuristic evaluation. Nevertheless, there were significant differences in the importance that was given to each problem. Usability experts emphasized in aspects that were not relevant to end users.},

Four experiments showed that individual evaluators were mostly quite bad at doing such heuristic evaluations and that they only found between 20 and 51\% of the usability problems in the interfaces they evaluated. On the other hand, we could aggregate the evaluations from several evaluators to a single evaluation and such aggregates do rather well, even when they consist of only three to five people.},

	abstract = {In usability context of interactive systems the heuristic evaluation method is widespread. In most applications the results tend to be qualitative, describing such aspects that require some improvement for the benefit of usability. However, these qualitative results do not allow us to determine how usable it is or how it becomes an interactive system. Hence the need for quantitative results may also be very necessary in order to determine the effort that would be needed to get a sufficiently usable system. This article describes, following the idea of the UsabAIPO Project, a new experiment to obtain quantitative results after a heuristic evaluation. This new experimentation has required some variation on the original idea, working with a set of different heuristic categories, while considering the use of the score depending on severity and frequency parameters.},
